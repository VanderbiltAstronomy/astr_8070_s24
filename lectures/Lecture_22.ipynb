    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "In a convolutional layer, each neuron is not connected to each neuron in the previous layer, but only those that are within its \"field of view\" as defined by a kernel (filter).  We slide the kernel over the input layer and the value in the next layer depends only on those pixels.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sparse layers or convolutional layers in a deep network contain a large number of hidden nodes but very few synapses. The sparseness arises from the relatively small size of a typical convolution kernel (15x15 is a large kernel), so a hidden node representing one output of the convolution is connected to only a few input nodes. Compare this the our previous perceptron, in which every hidden node was connected to every input node.\n",

The prior on this continuous distribution is a Gaussian with mean and variance. ***Therefore the intuition for variational autoencoders is that the mean vector centers the average encoding of the data point, while the variance samples around this average encoding.*** This allows the encoding and decoding to interpolate much more smoothly across the training data. \n",
